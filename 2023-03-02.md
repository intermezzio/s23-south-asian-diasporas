# Session 11

## Orientalism

- This was a **political vision of reality** exaggerating
differences between the East and the West, making the
East appear very strange in an effort to degrade them.
- Europeans felt that they were superior and needed to
uplift and save the rest of the world

## Asians in 19^th^ and 20^th^ Century Britain

- Mostly individual accounts exist
- Huge class variation
- South Asians were still viewed through orientalism because
they couldn't be seen as normal people
- Fear of Indian men marrying British women

## Indians in WWI and WWII

- Indians voluntarily fought in the war
- Many British-Indian relations at the time
- Strange time for Indians veterans after independence
