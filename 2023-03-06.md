## Compare and Contrast London v Dhaka

- Dhaka men were less employed
- Dhaka less social nets
- Religion (Islam) was important in both cultures
- In London people were more afraid of the outside
world
- Women were shamed for working with men
- \`\`Homework", or working on things at home like
sewing, were considered less shameful than getting
a job

## NIDL

_Globalization, Neoliberalism_

- Division of labor in the world has rearranged
- Production lines are stretched across the world
- Raw materials in one part of the world and textiles
in another part of the world
- Example: RCA started in Camden, moved around the
country, and later to Mexico and Southeast Asia for
cheap labor
- Manufacturing jobs shift to the developing world,
and recently, this begins to include more high-end
products like electronics and cars
- Effects manufacturing sector in the US and UK
- Manufacturing jobs no longer exist in the same way
for middle-class people in these countries
- Bifurcation between high-level and low-level jobs
with less in the middle
- Sex segregated work in small factories in ethnic
enclaves in the US and UK
- Women in the UK work at home
