### _24 April 2023_

# Session 20

## Review Maira Reading

- Different ways to classify citizenship
- Islam is a more "noticed" part of South Asian Muslim
identity post 9/11
- People can lose their citizenship
- Us versus them mentality after 9/11
- "Progressive citizenship" related to diversity citizenships,
etc.
- Golden cage of being part of the US but still trapped
- Very difficult to make formerly economically powerless
powerful, so they settled for culturally rich

## Why is Multicultural Citizenship Appealing

- Politics of representation foster a cultural rather than
structural analysis of social inequity
