# Session 8

## Goals of the Session

- Explore lives of early migrants to the United States
- Anti-miscegenation laws and effects on family
relationships in the 19^th^ and 20^th^ centuries
- Study land ownership laws
- Discuss the notion of hybridity
- Discuss how South Asian migrants were involved in
anti-colonial movements

## Discussion about Readings

- Alien land laws created a new power relationship between
men and women where women owned property
- There were power dynamics present because people who
owned land had power over the rest of the family, including
when the owners were wives or daughters
- There are more obvious forms of resistance, with problems
being presented even to the Supreme Court in the US as
opposed to legal systems in other countries
- Resistance and pushback is substantial even if the legal
system was unfair
- The law was used to fight against the law, with very
formal, legal arguments being used to demand rights
  - People were willing to put effort in hearings and other
  legal processes
  - This was prevalent in the US after the Civil War, with
  much of the Civil Rights movement being closely tied to
  legal cases like _Brown v. Board of Education_ and other
  laws
- Self-identification was interesting, with various groups
being combined into larger groups, like the overarching
term \`\`Hindu" being used to refer to all South Asians
regardless of religion
- Race was used as a social construct in a very openly
exploitative way: when a Punjabi proved his Caucasian
ancestry to claim his right to land, the Supreme Court
told him that even though he was technically \`\`white",
the law clearly wasn't written so that he could own land
because he was Punjabi

## Reconstruction Era

- White supremacy had cohered as an ideology
- It looked like it could be challenged, although there are
Jim Crow laws
- Around 1900, people believed that reconstruction had
failed, and that led to a new form of white supremacy where
instead of seeing black people as slaves and therefore
unequal, now nobody was a slave and people started to believe
that it was the race that made people unequal
