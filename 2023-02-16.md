### _16 February 2023_

# Session 7

## OBID Discussion

- The veil makes it hard to see people from
other perspectives
- Where do we fit as individuals in this system?
- Lots of self-reflection, especially because
many of us do not identify as purely white or
black, and being immigrants further complicates
these matters
- The veil is an invisible line that defines
many aspects of our lives
- Originally people create strata of races and
learning about them, now people have to take
responsibility to not conveniently forget this
- Shifting to take a more active role in acknowledging
racialization and mitigating the effects of it
as opposed to ignoring the effects of it

## Points form Itzigsohn / Brown

### Clearest

- Two-ness
- Existence of a barrier due to racialization
- Challenging dominant forms of knowledge is difficult
- Behind the veil you can see yourself and how others
treat you
- On the other end of the veil you only see your
biased perspective of the other people

### Muddiest

- Can there be multiple veils?
- Can it be removed or destroyed?
- One-way mirror versus two-way mirror
- What about people don't act like the rest of their
race, or if they're multiracial?
- What about societies the US perceives as \`\`one race"?

## Racial Groups in Apartheid

- White (British + Boer)
- Black (All African groups)
- Coloured (collapsing diverse indigenous groups and
\`\`mixed" groups)
- Indian (collapsing multiple migrations of people from
the Indian subcontinent)
- Further divided by tribal identity
- Multiracial towns with Indians and Africans were split up
so that Indian towns were separate
- Indians were not allowed in city centers without permission
and couldn't use the bathroom or do simple things until they
returned to their Indian parts of town
- Post-Apartheid public housing is still not in good shape
in many parts with drug issues and 60% unemployment

## Reinventing Indian Culture in Post-Apartheid South Africa

- During Apartheid, all non-Whites unified to identify as
black to stand against it
- Now, Indian culture is being reinvented in South Africa
- Lots of that cultural pressure to be more Indian
- Imitation of anti-colonial nationalist culture in India,
which regarded Indian women as bearers of pure Indian
culture and values
- People had a pressure to act Indian regardless of whether
or not they wanted to when indentured by the British
