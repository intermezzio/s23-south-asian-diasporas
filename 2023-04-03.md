# Session 15

## Gujarati Hotel and Motel Owners

- There exists a negative stereotype towards
Gujarati motel owners and Gujaratis in general
for business practices
- Stereotype persists among South Asians

## Mississippi Masala _(film)_

- Can be perceived as an interracial marriage
story but is about a lot more
- Complicated history of Indians and race in
the United States
- Meena has a different perception of Black
people than her parents
- People used socioeconomic status as a way
to demean or judge others as a substitute for
judging based on race

## Race and Asians as \`\`In-Between" People

- Two scales: superior vs inferior and
insider vs foreigner
- Whites and Blacks have been seen as
insiders, Asian is foreigner
- Whites have been seen as superior with
Asians in the middle and Blacks at the bottom

## Intimacy and Structure

- Political and ideological authorities
- Familial intimacy with expectations related to
ideology and values
