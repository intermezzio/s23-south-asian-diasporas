## Discussion about Readings

### Bellingham Riots

- This has largely been forgotten in history
- People from the area may remember anti East Asian racism
and other forms of racism but not anti South Asian racism
- South Asian Americans have rewritten the history with
a new wave of migration post 1965

- The definition of \`\`white" is surprisingly expansive (including Italians
and Scandinavians) for the 1800s
- They are so evidently racist regarding the fact that they're stating that
the \`\`Hindus" were never going to assimilate
- Ties to a notion of the \`\`common" (white) man, othering the South Asians
- It seems whiteness is a quantifiable measure of how similar the people are
to the majority race in the US and Europe, as if this were not a race but
rather a desirable characteristic
- Labels are very impersonal here
- Racial binary, as people are seen as \`\`white" or \`\`black"
- Bhagat Singh eventually became a citizen by becoming a veteran
- Deep scientific racism and social Darwinism at the time
