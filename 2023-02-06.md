## Review _Coolie Woman_ ch. 1-3

### Major points from orbit discussion:

- Identity
- Choice
- Upward mobility, especially for women

### Major points from group discussion:

- Grief
  - Distressing to think about what people endured
  - Women could do \`\`everything right" and end up
  forced to do things they didn't want to do
  - Realization that migration could be an act of
  desperation as opposed to an act of hope
  - Need for belonging but difficulty to accept
  a lack of belonging at times
- There were more, not noted here

### Origins of the word Coolie

Comes from kuli (laborer) but became a racial slur
when it was used to describe emigrants of
British India

### Chapter 1

Magician's box, comparing inside vs outside

- Associates Guiana with outside settings, like the
temple, house, etc.
- This soon becomes her inside setting in New Jersey
where her identity is more hidden from society
- Her fortress is her strength, not viewed as a
\`\`Third World basket case" like the US would perceive
it

Useful metaphor: **did this emigration set me free as well
as cut me in half?**

**Gender and Colonialism**

A big justification for colonialism was to free women from
oppression in their culture.

> \`\`White men are saving brown women from brown men"

_Sati_ = women burning upon husband's death

The practice was less about women being forced to die and
instead a practice limited to a small group in Northern
India that did it to ensure transfer of property

Ironically, the British disgust of the practice caused the
practice to grow, even enforcing Hindu law on the practices

> \`\`And indenture, too would liberate India's most
> oppressed women and thereby demonstrate empire's civilizing
> influence"

Civilization of women was used as a justification for the
recruitment process
