### _10 April 2023_

# Session 17

## Learning Goals

- Explore and describe the unique migration conditions
of temporary workers in neoliberalism
- Gender and migration is negotiation within families
connected to professional migration
- Understand gendered work in the diaspora
- Detail labor of diasporic women in IT
- Compare current IT work with indentured labor

## ORID about Banerjee Reading

- Nurses seemed to internalize problems while IT workers
blame the system for immigration-related issues
- Dependent spouses have a strange power dynamic when
one has the H1B visa
- Tech workers tend to stay silent about their issues with
visas which allows problems to persist and not get
addressed
- Bosses have an incredible amount of power because there
is no inherent legal power without a corporation
- What happens when corproations have the right to control
healthcare and other benefits like that?
- States have a stronger dynamic for input from common
citizens than corporations

## ORID About Carrot and Stick Quote

### Original Thoughts

- Ravish sees a difference in what he sees as reality and
what he originally assumed
- Technically "legal" but not really known, and the
situation makes you not seem like you're really legal
- The US is taking advantage of Ravish's future because
it knows how desirable the permanent residence is

### Feelings

- Emotionally very desperate
- Questioning if this was worth it
- Regret
- Frustration, getting trapped
- Understands the cost now
- Powerless
- Anger

### Comparable Labor Situations

- Indentured laborers and a promise for later reward
after exploitative work
- Seen as successful on the outside but suffering
silently
- Great expectations at work
- Correlated with STEM work in general, since jobs
are appealing but not as it would seem
