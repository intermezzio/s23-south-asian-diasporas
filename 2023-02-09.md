# Session 5

## Orbital Discussion, Ch 11

Key Points:

- Psychological impacts of leaving Cumberland
- Lots of domestic violence in the land, and how
women are very discriminated against in Guyana
in the present day
- Dangerous place for women, husbands often beat
wives and kill them with farm tools
- Introduction of rum to Guyana by the British
was bad for the people
- Immigration leaves people who stay in the country
in a worse situation
- Violence is etched into Guyana's culture
- The root of the problems can be traced to
colonial policies
- How much agency do people _really_ have?

Second Round of Discussion:

- Gender ratio of men to women is a probable cause
for some of the issues regarding marriage and domestic
violence
- Guyana is still a very dangerous place for women today
- Many houses are vacant now because a huge amount of
emigrants leave the country and still have houses, which
are now populated by squatters
- Many of the issues women face are comparable to other
parts of the world
