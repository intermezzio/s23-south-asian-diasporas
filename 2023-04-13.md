### _13 April 2023_

# Session 18

## Learning Goals

- Review readings
- Discuss annotated bibliography

## Discussion of readings

- H1B visas similar to visa functionality in the UAE
- Indentured labor is a helpful framework for these
  new visa programs
- Raises the question of how comfortable one can get
  in a place they don't know they'll live in

## Importance of Visa Regimes

Visa regimes play a huge role in the diaspora
because they control who goes where and the
conditions on which they move. The structure
of the H1B visa, for example, controls who
_wants to_ and _successfully can_ migrate
to the US, causing a lot of recent members of
the diaspora to come from technical backgrounds,
self-selecting people who will push through
very hard and unfavorable situations to migrate.
This also causes the subset of people in the
diaspora who successfully immigrate to be seen
as a model minority, affecting the perception
of their race as a whole in respective countries
where they travel. This contrasts heavily with
how the visas (or their alternatives) influenced
the perception of their race in different places
and time periods.

A lot of people get into STEM in order to get a visa

## The Paper

Central claim should be a clear, concise message that
is also provocative in making clear why the
interviewee's story is of significance to the study
of South Asian diasporas
